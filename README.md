# Deep Embedded Clustering Algorithm Implementation and Evaluation

This repository contains an implementation of the Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) algorithm, a powerful method for unsupervised learning and clustering in high-dimensional data. The DEC algorithm is particularly effective for tasks such as image clustering.

## Key Features:
- Implementation of the Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) algorithm.
- Evaluation of the DEC algorithm using the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets.
- Comprehensive testing and evaluation metrics for clustering accuracy.

## Datasets:
- CIFAR-10: A benchmark dataset for image classification with 10 classes.
- MNIST: A widely-used dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
